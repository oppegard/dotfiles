zstyle ':autocomplete:*' default-context ''
# '': Start each new command line with normal autocompletion.
# history-incremental-search-backward: Start in live history search mode.

zstyle ':autocomplete:*' min-delay 0.0  # number of seconds (float)
# 0.0: Start autocompletion immediately when you stop typing.

zstyle ':autocomplete:*' ignored-input '' # extended glob pattern
# '':     Always show completions.
# '..##': Don't show completions when the input consists of two or more dots.

# When completions don't fit on screen, show up to this many lines:
zstyle ':autocomplete:*' list-lines 16  # (integer)
# üí° NOTE: The actual amount shown can be less.

# If any of the following are shown at the same time, list them in this order:
zstyle ':completion:*:' group-order \
    expansions history-words options \
    aliases functions builtins reserved-words \
    executables local-directories directories suffix-aliases
# üí° NOTE: This is NOT the order in which they are generated.

# complete-word: (Shift-)Tab inserts the top (bottom) completion.
# menu-complete: Press again to cycle to next (previous) completion.
# menu-select:   Same as `menu-complete`, but updates selection in menu.
# ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: This can NOT be changed at runtime.

zstyle ':autocomplete:*' fzf-completion no
# no:  Tab uses Zsh's completion system only.
# yes: Tab first tries Fzf's completion, then falls back to Zsh's.
# ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: This can NOT be changed at runtime and requires that you have
# installed Fzf's shell extensions.

# Add a space after these completions:
zstyle ':autocomplete:*' add-space \
